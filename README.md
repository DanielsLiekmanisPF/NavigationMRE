# Navigation MRE
This is a minimum reproducible example for SwiftUI + Swift Composable Architecture 
issue where a NavigationLinkStore produces a runtime warning of:
`Perceptible state was accessed but is not being tracked. Track changes to state by wrapping your view in a 'WithPerceptionTracking' view.`
